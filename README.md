# SpotifyPlaylistGenerator

## Project Description
This project was done out of my curiosity to find a better solution to discovering new songs on Spotify. It was created using the Spotify API, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python. The app finds the user's top 20 songs played in the last recent months and then generates 3 recommendations per song that the user can cycle through and like or dislike to go through the recommendations. If the user has created a playlist and likes the song recommendation, it will automatically add the song to the newly created playlist.

## Key Caveat
Due to [Spotify Developer Guidelines](https://developer.spotify.com/community/news/2021/05/27/improving-the-developer-and-user-experience-for-third-party-apps/), unless you are added as a user of the app using your spotify information, you will not be able to experience the app.
